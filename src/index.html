                    <div class = "text">
                        Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental agreement for that vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you donâ€™t actually own the vehicle. 
                        Instead, a leasing company purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you make monthly payments to the leasing company for the duration of your lease. 
                        Some leases however, do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the end of the lease.
